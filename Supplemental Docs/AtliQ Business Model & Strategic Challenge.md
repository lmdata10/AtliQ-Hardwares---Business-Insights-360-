# The Business Context

## Company Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a global manufacturer of consumer electronics and computer peripherals (printers, mice, keyboards, accessories). Operating with a complex multi-channel distribution model across international markets, the company distributes through brick-and-mortar retailers, e-commerce platforms, direct-to-consumer channels, and regional distributors.

## Business Model

AtliQ's value chain spans:

- **Manufacturing** at centralized facilities
- **Warehousing & Logistics** across regional distribution hubs

- **End-Consumer Delivery** via partner stores and AtliQ's own storefronts

### Customer & Channel Architecture

- Retailers (Best Buy, Croma, Staples)
- E-Commerce Platforms (Amazon, Flipkart)

- Direct-to-Consumer (AtliQ eStore, exclusive outlets)

**Sales Channels:**

- **Retailer:** Physical brick-and-mortar locations (India, USA)

- **Distributor:** Country-level aggregators (China, South Korea)

## The Strategic Problem

### Root Challenge

Despite rapid growth, AtliQ faced increasing competitive pressure and operational complexity with no centralized data infrastructure to guide strategic decisions. This became evident through a costly Latin America market failure where the company opened its own stores based on limited survey data, resulting in significant losses with no analytics to validate or course-correct the decision.

### Key Issues

- **Fragmented Data:** Business intelligence scattered across disconnected Excel sheets with no single source of truth
- **Blind Spots:** No ability to track performance by customer segment, sales channel, or geographic market
- **Strategic Vulnerability:** Competitors operating as data-first organizations (e.g., Dell) outpacing AtliQ in market responsiveness
- **Decision Paralysis:** Lack of data-driven insights limiting confidence in market expansion decisions

### Strategic Trigger

> [!CAUTION]
> _"Dell is outpacing us because they operate like a data company."_

This realization prompted AtliQ's leadership to invest in analytics infrastructure as a competitive necessity, not a luxury.

---

## Project Objective

**Enable AtliQ to transition from a traditional operations-focused manufacturer to a data-driven organization** by:

1. **Digitizing the business model** through centralized data architecture
2. **Classifying the platform ecosystem** with clear performance metrics by channel and market
3. **Building analytics infrastructure** to support real-time decision-making
4. **Driving competitive resilience** through data-informed channel strategy and market prioritization
